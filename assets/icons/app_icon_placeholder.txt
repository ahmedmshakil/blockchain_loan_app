# App Icon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the app icon. In a real implementation, you would:

1. Create a 1024x1024 PNG icon with the banking theme
2. Use the bank's logo with blockchain elements
3. Include the Midnight Bank branding colors (primary blue)
4. Add subtle blockchain/link iconography

The icon should represent:
- Banking/Financial services (building, coins, etc.)
- Blockchain technology (chain links, blocks)
- Security and trust (shield, checkmark)
- Modern and professional appearance

For now, the app will use the default Flutter icon until a proper icon is designed.
